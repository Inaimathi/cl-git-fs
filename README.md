# cl-git-fs 0.01
#### A git filesystem utility

`cl-git-fs` is a port of [this](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filestore-0.3.2/docs/src/Data-FileStore-Git.html). Its goal is to allow the construction of file stores backed by [`git`](http://git-scm.com/) in Common Lisp.

#### This is still a development library

- It currently only supports SBCL
- Large chunks of the external API are subject to change
